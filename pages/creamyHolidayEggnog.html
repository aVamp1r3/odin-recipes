  <h4>Description</h4>
  <p>
  <em>  "I got this recipe from my mother's Southern Living Cookbook that she has had for at least 15 years or so. This
    eggnog is so creamy and delicious and the nutmeg gives it that bit of spice that makes this creamy holiday treat the
    perfect touch. I made this in my teen years a few times for Thanksgiving and Christmas and my family loved it. I
    haven't made it in awhile but i'm pretty sure I will be making it for my husband and I this year. Enjoy!"</em>
