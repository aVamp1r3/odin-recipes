    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Who can resist soft dinner rolls fresh from the oven? These dinner rolls
      bake up fluffy and golden with just a hint of sweetness. Brush warm rolls
      with melted butter just before serving.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups all-purpose flour, divided, or as needed</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
      <li>1 (.25 ounce) envelope Fleischmann's RapidRise Yeast</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>½ cup milk</li>
      <li>¼ cup water</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter, plus more for brushing</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine 3/4 cup flour, sugar, undissolved yeast, and salt in a large
        bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat milk, water, and 2 tablespoons butter in a saucepan until very warm
        (120 degrees to 130 degrees F).
      </li>
      <li>
        Add warm milk mixture to the flour mixture. Beat for 2 minutes on medium
        speed of an electric mixer, scraping the bowl occasionally. Add 1/4 cup
        flour; beat for 2 minutes at high speed. Stir in enough remaining flour
        to make soft dough.
      </li>
      <li>
        Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic, about
        8 to 10 minutes. Cover; let rest for 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Divide dough into 12 equal pieces.</li>
      <li>
        Shape pieces into balls and place in a greased 8-inch round pan. Cover
        and let rise in warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, about 30
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Bake rolls in the preheated oven until golden brown on top, about 20
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Brush with melted butter if you like; serve warm and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
